Anna F,Russian Federation,2021-02-08,"In July 2021, she traveled as part of a ten-day tour (in fact, 7 days) across the peninsula with the Vision of Kamchatka company. In short, we can describe this trip as: ""Kamchatka is beautiful in its nature, but the organization is complete horror."" I was ready to walk in the mountains and to meet a bear, I was ready to sleep in a tent at 5 degrees too. Not a spoiled tourist, she is well acquainted with the industry in other regions of Russia. I will highlight a couple of important points for the tour, which costs 160k. Non-professional guides (I would say accompanying groups), who together could neither tell anything interesting about their land, nor try to smooth out the numerous discontent of tourists in a polite manner. The complaints were about a poorly tailored program, where the group spent most of the time ""waiting for activities"" or food. Unfortunately, throughout the entire route, as a meal, two chefs offered us a ration of potato soup, pasta, bread, mayonnaise and biscuits. And, there were also pork cutlets and fish, which the members of the group themselves caught on a fishing trip. In general, if you do not eat any of the above, then you remain hungry. It is not joke. I want to note that this was not a hike: all the food along the route was carried by a rotary shift operator or a helicopter. I wrote a negative review about the trip for the first time, so that tourists choose the organizer of the trip to Kamchatka more carefully.

I caught everyone and everyone was very happy. Over a delicious dinner, we bragged about who got the fish and who caught what. Of course we were all very tired, but we were happy. The guides are top class and the cooks are deliciously fed. Sergey constantly pays attention to all groups .... I don't understand how there is enough of him for everyone. After the second day of fishing, we all went together to the bathhouse, that day it was cold on the river and we returned early to the heated bathhouse.

elena bryzgalova,Russian Federation,2020-10-05,"Going to Kamchatka this 2020 was almost equated to madness - the pandemic is in full swing, closed: all social facilities, including hotels and thermal pools, museums and catering facilities, the impossibility of infiltrating the city when passing through the arrival control at the airport ... And yet, we took a chance! And they were more than rewarded with the hospitality of the Kamchadals and the responsible attitude of the travel company, in whose reliable hands we fell. Still at home, in Vladivostok, looking for routes for traveling in Kamchatka for a group of different ages, having started preparing for the trip, we realized that we were not mistaken with the choice when we turned to the Land of the Earth Travel Company LLC. ""Land's End"" is what any, the most demanding tourist needs, where the price-per-tour ratio - the quality of tourist service is simply excellent. I would like to note the successful site of this tourist organization on the Internet, which is called ""To Kamchatka.ru"" (na-kamchatku.ru), it is very convenient, being on the site you can easily navigate in the information presented, there are answers to all questions of interest to the tourist, the possibility of feedback is provided, advice for all categories of tourists on equipment, clothes and shoes is thought out. And also a large list of possible combinations for choosing a tour is presented, taking into account the wishes of the tourist. The purpose of our trip is to show Kamchatka to a 10-year-old granddaughter. Therefore, comfort, food and safety were a priority. All this we found in the recommendations of the travel agency ""Land's End"". From the numerous offers of the company, we have chosen a 3-day tour “Mutnovsko-Gorelya group of volcanoes. Summer springs ""from September 24 to September 26, 2020. I would like to express my gratitude to this travel company and thank everyone together and each person individually. From the very first day of our acquaintance, we realized that we had turned to great professionals in the tourism business: the organization of the tour and the service of us, tourists, was excellent. To the coordinator of the travel agency ""Land of the Earth"", Irina, we contacted by phone with numerous questions an unimaginable number of times, and she always answered us with lightning speed in full volume of the question of interest. We would like to thank Irina for her patience and kindness, for the detailed information and efforts made by her to organize our trip. Our journey began at the specified time, without delay (at 8 o'clock in the morning), a comfortable KAMAZ drove up to the Pyramid shopping center, and we loaded into it with our things. Our guide on the trip was Sergey. He introduced himself, briefly told us about the composition of the main group, to which we are joining for this period of the trip. With Sergei, the 2-hour trip to the Karymshin camp site flew by like an instant. He is a very interesting conversationalist who is pleasant to listen to. Further, to the place of the tourist shelter, located behind the Vilyuchinsky pass in a very picturesque place, we drove together, with a close-knit 3-day rafting, a cheerful team of 20 tourists. Sergei entertained us all the way with various intellectual games, introduced everyone to us, and the road in his company seemed easy and very fast to everyone. Our driver turned out to be a real ace. The road, when ascending to the pass, was rather difficult, but we did not feel it in the KAMAZ cabin, as he drove the car just masterly. The tourist shelter (yellow two-story house) is located in a unique place, it is really very beautiful there. For tourists, the main conditions of the hike are a roof over their heads and food. The house is simply charming, cozy and unique - it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, sleep and communication. All the tourists quickly settled in their rooms, and then went to the dining room for dinner. For lunch there was a real luxurious pickle soup and buckwheat with a cutlet. Chef Valery is a professional, as we are grateful to him for delicious porridge with fragrant croutons in the morning, excellent soups and main courses for lunch, and every evening delights for dinner. At the table, we forgot that we were on a hike, because all the food was restaurant-grade - amazingly tasty. Thank you, Valera! The main housekeeper is Peter, he organizes the order in the shelter, monitors the heating of the rooms, the cleanliness of the toilets and other household little things that are no longer small things far from home. Thank you, Petya, you are an excellent manager! The rooms were well ventilated and the sleeping bags were warm and dry. Electricity was supplied on time, and we always had time to charge the gadgets that had been hooked up during the day, to dry the soaked things. Climbing volcanoes were wonderful, largely due to the coordination of actions of our guides Sergei and Alexei. Sergey was in charge, he went ahead everywhere, built the optimal route depending on weather conditions, the complexity of the terrain and the preparedness of tourists. I would like to say a lot of warm words about Seryozha. He is an amazing guide and person. We thank him for the excellent organization of climbing the Gorely and Mutnovsky volcanoes. Our group was very different in age, from a 10-year-old child to adults over 70, while Sergei took into account the physical capabilities of all participants in the hike, adjusted his ascent speed for each of us. He had his own approach to all tourists, each of us was told some of his cherished words, from which appeared inner strength and confidence that the volcanoes would be conquered by us. There are no words to express my gratitude to him for his patience and kind attitude towards us. We got great pleasure from this difficult, magnificently beautiful, path. Sergey's ability to convey the beauty of nature, to focus our attention on the most advantageous types of volcanoes, to pay attention to what could have been missed without him, it's worth a lot! Our guide constantly charged us with his energy, optimism, told us a lot about volcanoes, about different cases of climbing them. On the way, he patiently answered numerous questions, made intermediate stops on the way, so that we had time to take a breath, relax and have time to photograph the most beautiful moments of the ascents. The route turned out to be interesting and very funny, full of delight from his stories and subtle humor. Aleksey closed our group - I have never met a kinder and more attentive person, not a single bad word addressed to those who lagged behind, trudged on their last legs or were capricious, a broad-minded person who is simply irreplaceable on slippery glaciers or narrow paths. She will always lend a helping hand and cheer, in word and deed. Alexey is just an Angel of the campaign, on difficult sections of the path, he literally saved us from a wrong step, always guarded and told us where to put our foot so as not to slip down, educated, tactful, in an undertone he supplemented Sergey's stories with interesting facts and stories. An amazing tandem. How lucky we are with our guides! Thanks to the guys-guides that we did not pass by the Summer Springs, this is such an enchanting place and the most interesting walk for our granddaughter (and not only for her), because there it was so wonderfully smoking, steaming, gurgling, boiling, hissing and bubbling of various colors and the density of an amazing brew of Mother Earth. I will not describe the climbing of volcanoes themselves, because you can read and watch a lot about it on the Internet, I will only say that it was difficult for me and my granddaughter, at times it was very cold and windy, while the ascent was easy for my husband. On the way back, having bathed a lot in the thermal pools of the Karymshiny camp site, we were transferred to the car to the head of the travel agency Oleg, who took us to the very porch of the house, in the car we talked a little and say thank you to him for the light of communication that he gave us. Most of all, our family would like to say gratitude for the teamwork, for the high professionalism of the employees of the travel company ""Land's End"", who provided us, tourists, with everything necessary for an exciting journey to climb volcanoes. Despite the fact that at one time we went through similar routes more than once on our own, this trip became a discovery for us, because with your help our vacation was the most comfortable, we did not worry about anything, did not worry about tomorrow, due to this made him the most memorable and safest. In conclusion, we recommend that all tourists shift their burdens of tourist life: accommodation, travel, and carrying a lot of kilogram backpacks onto the shoulders of a specialized team of professionals in the tourism business of LLC ""Land of the Earth"", it is they who will make your future trip to Kamchatka unforgettable, trust this tourist organization, and you will understand how much better, more comfortable and better your vacation at the end of the earth can be.

In addition to volcanoes, Kamchatka has a wonderful ocean, so a boat trip is also a must. I recommend Russkaya Bay, but you can take a closer look, Starichkov Island, for example. Luxurious views of the Kamchatka shores, sea animals, fishing. Moreover, even those who have never caught fish will catch fish. The Bears. There are 15-20 thousand of them in Kamchatka, but they know how to be invisible and it is better not to want to meet them in the forest. Therefore, if you want to observe and take pictures of bears in Kamchatka, fly to Kuril Lake. Alloys - I have not been there, but somehow it seems to me that they differ from alloys in the Urals and Altai only by the types of volcanoes on the backstage. Weather. She is unpredictable. But somehow it doesn't hurt to enjoy Kamchatka. Take the correct shoes and clothes at least 3 sets with you. I have been to Kamchatka twice and each time I understood that everything could have been organized better. Of course, you can order a tour from a travel agency. But then you have no flexibility, and helicopters require weather. My ideal trip to Kamchatka for 11-12 days. Not for active tourists (carry backpacks on yourself). 4 (5) days - active volcano Klyuchevskaya Sopka. A day by car to the foot, a day or two to walk, climb higher, and you can fly by helicopter. Day - back by car. On the way, you can climb Tabanchik, but when flying to the Valley of Geysers, you will see it magnificently from above. Day 1 - Valley of Geysers. This is not only the Valley of Geysers, it is also a beautiful caldera of the super volcano Uzon and bathing in hot springs. 1 day Kuril Lake, and this is perhaps the best trip in Kamchatka. The views from the helicopter are stunning, intermediate landing in the crater of a long-extinct volcano, and the lake itself. One could fly and just see the lake without bears, it is so beautiful, but the main feature of the Kuril Lake is the Kamchatka bears. Do not describe - see the photo. Day 1 - Russkaya Bay. On the Killer Whale boat, 5 people simultaneously came up with the idea - how beautiful Russia is. And this is no coincidence - indescribable views of home volcanoes, Gorely volcano from the sea, graceful killer whales dancing around the boat, lazy seals on the rocks, birds ... 3 days Mutnovsky, Gorely, a small valley of Geysers, Gorely caves and a thermal power plant. If you contact travel agencies, they will write this program for you for 4 days. And you won't really see anything - you will only spend 26 hours on the road) But if you get to Gorely and camp there for 2 nights (here's an overnight stay in tents), Gorely always has someone's camp, so it's not scary. Having a cross-country vehicle at your disposal, you will examine everything in detail and take pictures to your heart's content, buy from wild sources. Day 1 Ethnographic excursion. For example, I am a fan of such excursions - to watch the dances of the peoples of Kamchatka, ride a dog sled, taste local food. And in conclusion, hot springs.",10,tripadvisor,Kamchatka Peninsula,Russia,RUS,233,"Kamchatka I consider everyone who<br>considers himself a traveler MUST! visit<br>Kamchatka.

174vkk69,Russian Federation,2016-03-08,"Impressions from Kamchatka are similar to the sensations of a skillful swimmer, who met a huge ocean cool wave that appeared from nowhere, playfully picked you up and slowly carried you towards the coast ... here it is carrying you, it takes your breath away, there is no internet, communication is junk, it would be nice to jump on a board or on a helicopter ... But I forgot the board at home, and the flying machine is expensive ... The Kamchadals will read this wet preface of my travel notes and will not react in any way. At least right away. And it is right. Let's see what will happen next. Or maybe nothing will happen. It is also quite possible. Nothing has changed in Kamchatka for centuries and everything changes very quickly. Like the weather - three times a day. Therefore, what will happen next in this story is interesting to me ... The seventeen-hour flight from Yekaterinburg to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky is a separate song. Three verses - two choruses - in Irkutsk and Vladivostok. Crews change in every city. And with them, the style of piloting and the producers of what is served with ""meat-chicken-fish"". During the last flight segment, this trio became a duet, and the landing left the feeling that in Irkutsk, after a perfect landing at the plane, the rubber was changed to the landing gear and in Vladivostok it broke up, and in Petropavlovka it was downright squared ... But how they joked in Ural dumplings about the motto of one of the airlines - we fly - thank God! Under the wing of the plane, nothing really sang, but on approaching the peninsula, they fell into an amazing cloudiness, similar to an endless field of cream stalactites, which seemed to stretch towards the sky from the earth itself. The plane confidently dived into this white mist and suddenly it parted and one of the largest bays in the world appeared - Avachinskaya. More than her, only the Australian in Port Jackson Bay. At the airport, we were really warmly greeted by our relatives, and naturally, at once a lot of organizational issues disappeared into the haze of the Avachinsky and Karyaksky volcanoes, which are visible from almost anywhere in the city. On the way, I tried to access the Internet from my phone - to no avail. At home, from a stationary computer, it was possible to do this with great difficulty and then for a short time. In the search engine, the first popped up ""Kamchatka-tour"" where we ordered a boat trip for tomorrow. The next day we arrived at the appointed place to the Shamsa shopping center. The guide Luda, being a couple of minutes late, hastily counted us and showed us where to go. We went down to the coast and, after waiting a couple of minutes, phoned the manager of the travel agency. We were assured that everything is fine, Luda is on the spot, we are on the spot .. The connection was cut off .... After a couple of minutes of phoning, it turned out that the boat sailed without us ... who became very ashamed of the travel agency that dishonored his native land with its activities. An hour later, we had already forgotten about this annoying incident, because we reached the Khalaktyrsky beach. It is interesting what Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol would write when he saw the endless ocean coast with many kilometers of huge waves slowly rolling onto the shore of the black sand sparkling in the sun ... A rare surfer will swim Khalaktyrka in one day. Swimming is 30 kilometers, and the water even in the warmest month of August does not warm more than 15 degrees ... But you can sunbathe and take surfing lessons. There is an area for tourists: wooden paths, tents, benches, information stands. While we were meditating on the shore, about twenty people drove up and noisily sat down at a large table. Day of the motorist is a very revered holiday in Kamchatka. We went the other way - to the surfers. They are quieter. Guys go all over the world, in Kamchatka the waves are great. You can learn to catch a wave here as well. Wetsuits, equipment available, inexpensive. Leaving, they took with them the black sand. Please note that at the airport, he will ring at the security check. And if they understand you in Petropavlovs-Kamchatsky, then there will be problems elsewhere. Let's skip the heartbreaking details of refunds for a failed excursion. Oddly enough, no one was going to apologize. They offered to write a complaint to the director, which we, naive Ural tourists, did. They indicated their coordinates, mail, phone. We have been waiting for an answer for the seventh month already. We thought maybe as a bonus they would offer some discount on the next excursion ... But the wrong ones were attacked ... The tourist is pounding, and if one or two are forgotten somewhere, it's okay. The second time they won't come to figure it out - it's a long way off. And in the end, it’s the salvation of the drowning — the work of the drowning themselves. But enough about the black stripe - let's move on to the white one. If you have rented a car or your friends are driving you around Kamchatka, plan to end your difficult tourist day at the Paratunsky thermal springs. It is not far from Petropavlovsk. Nothing special, in different recreation centers there are some differences in the design of the pools and the temperature of the water. Everything is very simple, but the impressions were the warmest. Pools are open. Once it was cooler - a strong wind was blowing and it was necessary to stick out less on the surface. The other was warmer, the sun warmed. The local population also loves these sources, so you can inadvertently overhear the unhurried conversation of the Kamchadals and feel like an alien. It seems that everything is like everywhere else, the water is not hot, the slight smell of hydrogen sulfide, the correct Russian speech, but something is wrong, the sky is different, the sun is shining at a different angle, the Earth is spinning more slowly ... As time passed, these impressions, which somehow did not exist right away , become on a par with the brightest. There were also super bright impressions from Paratunka, but let's leave their description for dessert. You can read about the history of Kamchatka, ethnos, Bering and Ivan Fedorovich Kruzenshtern on the Internet or in advertising brochures. There is not much printed literature. Kamchatka was closed to foreigners until the 90s of the last century, and also to our tourists. Yuri Senkevich, they say, called this region the most beautiful in the world, but I personally have not heard, so I will not argue, but I agree with this with the proviso ""one of the most ..."". And to watch it becomes more and more expensive. Foreigners with their currency spoiled local tour operators a little, but not all. The most important thing here is that everything is decided by the weather, which you will not ask to change for any money. We found an inexpensive helicopter tour to the valley of geysers for “only” 30,000 rubles per person, but we couldn't fly away - it was foggy. Then another excursion, then the next, and then it's time to go home. The ten-day trip turned out to be rich and successful. But it’s difficult to say what it is in two or three words. You have to see it with your own eyes, and then realize and feel it. Here you can't get away with a smiley or a colorful phrase. And then how to describe the taste of sea urchin caviar, the sulphurous smell of a volcano, the color of rhododendron, or the look of a bear with two cubs, who looks at you closely from two hundred meters ... Although our language is great and mighty, it is simply not able to betray all the shades and power Kamchatka Territory, which is in no hurry to show all its beauty to an idle tourist. We will tell you about a sea walk along Avacha Bay, a trip to the Mutnovsky volcano, tasting red caviar and what is the similarity between Gorely volcano and V.N.",10,tripadvisor,Kamchatka Peninsula,Russia,RUS,233,"Impressions from Kamchatka are similar to<br>the sensations of a skillful swimmer, who<br>met a huge ocean cool wave that appeared<br>from nowhere, playfully picked you up and<br>slowly carried you towards the coast ...<br>here it is carrying you, it takes your<br>breath away, there is no internet,<br>communication is junk, it would be nice to<br>jump on a board or on a helicopter ...

Three verses - two choruses - in<br>Irkutsk and Vladivostok. Crews change in<br>every city. And with them, the style of<br>piloting and the producers of what is<br>served with ""meat-chicken-fish"". During<br>the last flight segment, this trio became<br>a duet, and the landing left the feeling<br>that in Irkutsk, after a perfect landing<br>at the plane, the rubber was changed to<br>the landing gear and in Vladivostok it<br>broke up, and in Petropavlovka it was<br>downright squared ... But how they joked<br>in Ural dumplings about the motto of one<br>of the airlines - we fly - thank God!<br>Under the wing of the plane, nothing<br>really sang, but on approaching the<br>peninsula, they fell into an amazing<br>cloudiness, similar to an endless field of<br>cream stalactites, which seemed to stretch<br>towards the sky from the earth itself. The<br>plane confidently dived into this white<br>mist and suddenly it parted and one of the<br>largest bays in the world appeared -<br>Avachinskaya. More than her, only the<br>Australian in Port Jackson Bay. At the<br>airport, we were really warmly greeted by<br>our relatives, and naturally, at once a<br>lot of organizational issues disappeared<br>into the haze of the Avachinsky and<br>Karyaksky volcanoes, which are visible<br>from almost anywhere in the city. On the<br>way, I tried to access the Internet from<br>my phone - to no avail. At home, from a<br>stationary computer, it was possible to do<br>this with great difficulty and then for a<br>short time. In the search engine, the<br>first popped up ""Kamchatka-tour"" where we<br>ordered a boat trip for tomorrow. The next<br>day we arrived at the appointed place to<br>the Shamsa shopping center. The guide<br>Luda, being a couple of minutes late,<br>hastily counted us and showed us where to<br>go. We went down to the coast and, after<br>waiting a couple of minutes, phoned the<br>manager of the travel agency. We were<br>assured that everything is fine, Luda is<br>on the spot, we are on the spot .. The<br>connection was cut off .... After a couple<br>of minutes of phoning, it turned out that<br>the boat sailed without us ... who became<br>very ashamed of the travel agency that<br>dishonored his native land with its<br>activities. An hour later, we had already<br>forgotten about this annoying incident,<br>because we reached the Khalaktyrsky beach.<br>It is interesting what Nikolai Vasilyevich<br>Gogol would write when he saw the endless<br>ocean coast with many kilometers of huge<br>waves slowly rolling onto the shore of the<br>black sand sparkling in the sun ... A rare<br>surfer will swim Khalaktyrka in one day.<br>Swimming is 30 kilometers, and the water<br>even in the warmest month of August does<br>not warm more than 15 degrees ... But you<br>can sunbathe and take surfing lessons.<br>There is an area for tourists: wooden<br>paths, tents, benches, information stands.<br>While we were meditating on the shore,<br>about twenty people drove up and noisily<br>sat down at a large table. Day of the<br>motorist is a very revered holiday in<br>Kamchatka. We went the other way - to the<br>surfers. They are quieter. Guys go all<br>over the world, in Kamchatka the waves are<br>great. You can learn to catch a wave here<br>as well. Wetsuits, equipment available,<br>inexpensive. Leaving, they took with them<br>the black sand. Please note that at the<br>airport, he will ring at the security<br>check. And if they understand you in<br>Petropavlovs-Kamchatsky, then there will<br>be problems elsewhere. Let's skip the<br>heartbreaking details of refunds for a<br>failed excursion. Oddly enough, no one was<br>going to apologize. They offered to write<br>a complaint to the director, which we,<br>naive Ural tourists, did. They indicated<br>their coordinates, mail, phone. We have<br>been waiting for an answer for the seventh<br>month already. We thought maybe as a bonus<br>they would offer some discount on the next<br>excursion ... But the wrong ones were<br>attacked ... The tourist is pounding, and<br>if one or two are forgotten somewhere,<br>it's okay. The second time they won't come<br>to figure it out - it's a long way off.<br>And in the end, it’s the salvation of the<br>drowning — the work of the drowning<br>themselves. But enough about the black<br>stripe - let's move on to the white one.<br>If you have rented a car or your friends<br>are driving you around Kamchatka, plan to<br>end your difficult tourist day at the<br>Paratunsky thermal springs. It is not far<br>from Petropavlovsk. Nothing special, in<br>different recreation centers there are<br>some differences in the design of the<br>pools and the temperature of the water.<br>Everything is very simple, but the<br>impressions were the warmest. Pools are<br>open. Once it was cooler - a strong wind<br>was blowing and it was necessary to stick<br>out less on the surface. The other was<br>warmer, the sun warmed. The local<br>population also loves these sources, so<br>you can inadvertently overhear the<br>unhurried conversation of the Kamchadals<br>and feel like an alien. It seems that<br>everything is like everywhere else, the<br>water is not hot, the slight smell of<br>hydrogen sulfide, the correct Russian<br>speech, but something is wrong, the sky is<br>different, the sun is shining at a<br>different angle, the Earth is spinning<br>more slowly ... As time passed, these<br>impressions, which somehow did not exist<br>right away , become on a par with the<br>brightest. There were also super bright<br>impressions from Paratunka, but let's<br>leave their description for dessert. You<br>can read about the history of Kamchatka,<br>ethnos, Bering and Ivan Fedorovich<br>Kruzenshtern on the Internet or in<br>advertising brochures. There is not much<br>printed literature. Kamchatka was closed<br>to foreigners until the 90s of the last<br>century, and also to our tourists. Yuri<br>Senkevich, they say, called this region<br>the most beautiful in the world, but I<br>personally have not heard, so I will not<br>argue, but I agree with this with the<br>proviso ""one of the most ..."". And to<br>watch it becomes more and more expensive.<br>Foreigners with their currency spoiled<br>local tour operators a little, but not<br>all. The most important thing here is that<br>everything is decided by the weather,<br>which you will not ask to change for any<br>money. We found an inexpensive helicopter<br>tour to the valley of geysers for “only”<br>30,000 rubles per person, but we couldn't<br>fly away - it was foggy. Then another<br>excursion, then the next, and then it's<br>time to go home. The ten-day trip turned<br>out to be rich and successful. But it’s<br>difficult to say what it is in two or<br>three words. You have to see it with your<br>own eyes, and then realize and feel it.<br>Here you can't get away with a smiley or a<br>colorful phrase. And then how to describe<br>the taste of sea urchin caviar, the<br>sulphurous smell of a volcano, the color<br>of rhododendron, or the look of a bear<br>with two cubs, who looks at you closely<br>from two hundred meters ... Although our<br>language is great and mighty, it is simply<br>not able to betray all the shades and<br>power Kamchatka Territory, which is in no<br>hurry to show all its beauty to an idle<br>tourist. We will tell you about a sea walk<br>along Avacha Bay, a trip to the Mutnovsky<br>volcano, tasting red caviar and what is<br>the similarity between Gorely volcano and<br>V.N.",2016

Irina T,Russian Federation,2015-11-27,"My husband and I were in Kamchatka in September 2015 with our friends, by the way, whom we met in February on the island of Borneo. We only had four full days. After a long flight, having rested for two hours, we went to the ocean, to a beach with black sand. It was cloudy and it was raining a little, but this did not affect the impression of what he saw. The power of the Pacific Ocean is beyond words. It is very unusual to see not white sand, but black. On the street it was not hot to swim, we did not. We saw fans of boarding in the ocean. After that we went to the thermal springs of the Ozerki. The entrance cost 300 rubles per person. We sat in baths with different water temperatures and plunged into an icy lake. The effect is great. Only please, if you are going there, you must take off your jewelry, otherwise silver and a little gold will darken. The second day we went to Malki. On the way, we stopped by the Kamchatka tradition in the Pie Paradise, there are very tasty pies. After eating, we went on to adventure. We were waiting for rafting down the Bystraya river on a raft. The cost is 2,900 rubles per person and plus 200 rubles a license (voucher for fishing (catching), for fishing in the river. Raft is loudly said, the river was quite calm, the man who drove the boat just made sure that we sailed away from the shore. we had spini, on which we tried to catch fish. In the end, we failed to catch. The river was deep after heavy rains, so they explained to us why the fish did not bite. We swam for three hours watching beautiful landscapes around. Alas, we did not see bears At the end of the walk we saw fishermen who were lucky enough to catch a fish from the Golets. They gave us a photo of it. After a walk along the river we went to thermal springs, where we sat in small reservoirs with hot thermal water. Entry from one car 600 rubles. The third day we visited Kozelsky volcano in the morning and in the afternoon were near Avachinsky and Koryaksky volcanoes. little girl, it's such a pleasure. Of course, volcanoes impress with their grandeur and beauty. Snow on the peaks. The road to volcanoes is the bed of a mountain river, along which snow melts in June-July. The road is, of course, without asphalt. In the evening we went to the thermal springs called Paratunka. There is a large swimming pool. Entrance 300 rubles per person. The fourth day we had a boat trip along the Avacha Bay. The cost of the walk is 3,900 rubles per person. The weather was sunny. The colors of nature were very bright. We swam near beautiful rocks, grottoes. The views of the volcanoes at home are beautiful. We saw the Vilyuchinsky volcano. We sailed on the Starichkov island, where many birds live. Kamchatka's business card, Three Brothers rocks, stand at the entrance to the bay. On board we were fed fish soup with very tasty and fried flounder, which was caught on the donk by all the participants of the walk. My husband caught three flounders himself. We were fed boiled crabs (strigun). Very fresh and delicious. Kamchatka has its own microclimate. It looks like September, but everything is green, our friends have gorgeous lilies with buds at their dacha, potatoes are still growing green, carrots, flowers and no one in general is a reminder of autumn.

SergeiKSMksm,Russian Federation,2015-09-16,"When traveling to the Mutnovskaya mini valley of geysers, I recommend visiting the Vilyuchinskie thermal springs. You can find out the turn from travelers or indicate the approximate location in the photo from Google Earth. These sources are interesting because there is a travertine dome (you can read about it on the Internet). The road runs along the slope of the mountain and is washed away during floods. But oddly enough, I was able to drive to the Suzuki Escudo. True, the whole body was scratched and almost blew the handout on the stones. Therefore, I recommend when traveling a more passable jeep such as Surf, well, of course Kruzak 80 or Suzuki Jiminy. You can walk. On the way, a little to the side is a beautiful waterfall. The springs are located near the former geological prospecting party. There are abandoned gold mines nearby. The geologists' base was apparently bought out by the art critics of Kamchatka. We have built comfortable houses. Nearby there is a swimming pool with thermal water. In the evenings they arrange musical evenings: grand piano, piano, etc. in general, people of art. The houses are not rented out, but they are allowed in the evenings. Near the houses there is a collection of flesh-veined minerals with gold veins. It is better to put the tent near them, as bears roam. The road to the springs is equipped with bridges. The most interesting thing is the travertine dome. It was formed obviously for thousands of years. It is forbidden to beat off pieces. In order not to destroy the natural monument. You can get there only when there is no snow. In principle, you can drive in the rain. I do not recommend it in case of a cyclone, as I think that there is a river running along the road. In winter, a helicopter flies to the houses, as I think there is a lot of snow there in winter. What else I think is interesting so. That salmon are swimming in the river. When we visited the springs there lived some sort of Siberian out of this world. His bivouac stood apart from the place of landing of tourists in order to be away from the bustle of the world. I did not reach the place and went to sleep in the car for the night. In the morning I was woken up by a tourist who was removing large stones from the road. Then an informal Siberian came up to me. I told him. That he has been living for the second month and comes there every year. He says that this is some kind of special place on earth. I asked him: ""And you are not afraid of bears."" He replied: “No, I'm not afraid. We must treat them with respect, i.e. don't chase him. For if you run and take pictures and get to his lair, here he will turn from a good-natured taiga inhabitant into a real beast. You yourself understand that if a kitten is robbed of a piece of meat, he will start to get angry. Likewise, the bear considers his home inviolable. "" By the way, when we were there and in the morning went to the springs on the road we saw bear excrement. True, the bear was still young. Apparently he only moved away from his mother, so he was stupid and apparently ate what the tourists left. By the way, it is absolutely impossible to leave food and feed the bears. Since the bear will get used to this and, firstly, it will cease to get food on its own, and secondly, it will be near people and at any moment may attack when it is not given a treat. The most important feature of the bear is that it shows that it is close. Since literally in 10-15 minutes bathers passed in front of us and did not see the excrement of the bear. The bear deliberately went out on the road and marked that he was next.

It turns out that Travis Rice also used the services of this company in January 2014, as evidenced by the inscription on the T-shirt under the glass on the wall of the airport terminal. The helipad is a whole airport with a good air terminal. It is located not far from Paratunka. The pilots are excellent professionals !!! The best pilots work for this company !!! We flew to Kuril Lake, took pictures with bears fishing. Each group on the lake is greeted by a ""friend of the heart"" with a shotgun and accompanied at every step, because it is very dangerous !!! There are a lot of bears, they walk freely, feed, they are the owners there, and people came to take pictures and eat their fish on the shore. I refused to ride a boat on the lake, because the wind and waves rose, despite the sunny day - it was cold. We were served lunch, packed like on an airplane. Tea, coffee in thermoses. There is an interesting souvenir shop in the tent; a good saleswoman works there. On the way back there were stops in the Ksudich volcano caldera with warm lakes inside, a very interesting stop !!! At the foot of some other volcanoes, to swim in hot springs, where the hot lakes themselves I did not like - mud !!!! Outright human filth and disorder. But the forest is very rich !!! Berries, mushrooms at arm's length !! We circled over the Gorely volcano - the pilot showed the class !!! Respect and respect !!! Then they returned home for a long time. The city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky is a small port town with a small number of attractions that can be bypassed in a couple of days. There are no normal restaurants there. The pubs are just booze. Yelizovo, where the airport is located, is even less interesting. Although it is there that there is a place called ""Kamcha.tochka"", where you can buy not expensive very high quality fish and caviar. And the best place to stay is Paratunka with its numerous sanatoriums, hotels and rest houses - ringing silence, peace, clean air, good water. We went to all the thermal springs: Ozerki, Malki and some other ... I didn't like it anywhere !!!

Again human dirt ... They could not go to the ocean for crab fishing - there was a storm on the ocean, the bay was closed. The crabs themselves are delicious when freshly caught. They did not climb the volcanoes - and so it is difficult to breathe there, and even to strain, to go up the mountain! Hard! And you need to have a very experienced and friendly, humane instructor for such an ascent, otherwise people there every year die in batches, considering the ascent to be child's play. You can go to the natural park Nalychevo for a couple of days, especially if clear weather is expected. My husband always goes on rafting with friends, he likes it.

Purified and warmed by the balneological thermal waters of Paratunka.

Desislava M,Russian Federation,2014-03-29,"I traveled a lot around the country and thought that nothing would surprise me anymore, but not Kamchatka.

The biggest problem of traveling to Kamchatka is very expensive air tickets during the summer season. A direct flight can cost 50-60 thousand, while in winter, if you buy tickets in advance, you can keep within 10-15 thousand (even in winter there is something to do - ride a dog, ski, ride snowmobiles to volcanoes).

I don’t think that<br>somewhere else, except Kamchatka (Lake<br>Kurilskoe), you can see a horde of bears<br>in their natural habitat, fishing, on the<br>way back, take a helicopter in the middle<br>of a picturesque valley surrounded by<br>volcanoes and swim in a wild natural hot<br>spring. I also recommend to everyone the<br>local beer, which is called ""Kamchatskoe"",<br>try it, you will not regret it - it is<br>live beer, brewed according to classical<br>Soviet technology, on old Soviet<br>equipment, with a short (15 days) shelf<br>life. But the city itself and especially<br>the airport are terrible. It is a seaside<br>city: the buildings are shabby, there are<br>many rickety private houses, you can feel<br>some kind of neglect in everything. And<br>the airport - it generally sucks - the<br>hustle and bustle, crowds of people,<br>queues everywhere. Garbage, dirt<br>everywhere. And yet - do not believe the<br>myths about the local cheapness of red<br>fish, caviar and other delicacies. All of<br>this is expensive. But very fresh, yes.",2013

Even before going, they were responsive to answer all my questions and super helpful. I had a lovely group of 10 travelers and the BEST guides Vitaliy and Diana (translator). I have done many group trips before with many different experiences with guides, and by far this team was incredible. Vitaliy is amazing, he went above and absolutely beyond to not only educate us about his home, Kamchatka, but really made his best effort to make us as comfortable as possible. It is a very physically demanding job, in / out of the truck with bags, camping gear, etc, but he always was there to lend a hand and breezed through the hikes as we were all huffing and puffing, lol. He was also VERY well educated and informed about the topography and geography of Kamchatka and I really learned a lot. Diana was AMAZING! She spoke EXCELLENT English and also made many efforts to keep us happy and comfortable as well, always going beyond her call of duty. We were VERY lucky that they got along super well and that our whole group got along as it is a taxing trip, hours and hours on bumpy roads, the volcano hiking is quite difficult, and it is fairly remote. There is some down time, so I definitely recommend bringing cards or books (we didn't have access to electricity and power for many days). The cook was good, she did the best with what we could get on the road. Not the healthiest of foods, but considering the circumstances, we were definitely well fed and I think most of us actually gained weight. As weather is quick changing there, as I think 99% of any tour to Kamchatka is, we did have to change our itinerary a bit, but everything worked out and we had some VERY VERY lucky days and also unlucky days (as far as weather ). Vitaliy was great about making decisions on what would be the best and safest, and we all trusted him completely. The tents and equipment were all good and we were lucky that we got a 'newer' truck that was spacious enough. It could fit 14 and we were only 10, and they were saying the next group had 14 people, which would definitely make it really really tight, so am thankful we only had 10 people. We did volcano hiking at all 4 volcanoes, Tolbachik, Gorely, Mutnovsky, and Avachinsky - all unique in their own right and had breathtaking views (climbs not so easy). I loved exploring the volcanoes and especially seeing the flowers that can grow there, very beautiful. The added trips to Kuril Lake (which I did, was AMAZING) and the geysers was easily arranged for by Lost World.

Sam61HongKong,China,2018-09-09,"I just came back from Kamchatka and wanted to report another way to do independent travel there — by renting a four-wheel drive car. This is not as cheap as what emorre just described, but significantly less expensive for families than joining a tour. There are five people in my family, so it would be pretty expensive if each member joined a tour. By renting a car, it is possible to go out of town to some of the more scenic sites on your own, at your own pace, without spending a fortune. Companies like Hertz or Avis do not operate in Kamchatka, but we went with a local company called CarGo41, run by a Russian named Sergey. He also helped us arrange helicopter tours, found hotels, and arranged visas for us. Initially, I was worried about working with CarGo given the lack of an international reputation. When he offered to reserve a car for us without requiring any kind of a deposit, I was a little worried. I actually arrived in Kamchatka three days late because of flight delays, but he delivered the car to me and did not even ask me to pay for the three days that he held the car for me. His cars are not new like those at Hertz, but they were good enough for what I wanted to do - which was to travel to the back country on dirt roads. Sergey was extremely helpful. Once we lost our luggage on the dirt road. He went through the local social media, discovered that the luggage had been picked up by a local tour company, and then went across town to pick it up for us! Fantastic service. One caution that I have about independent travel in Kamchatka is that the English level is not very high, so I had to communicate using a google translator. Despite not being able to read Russian, it was relatively easy to find places using the GPS on the phone and an app called maps.me. Sergey pinpointed all the locations to visit on the app, so I just followed it. We visited Gorley, Mutsonova, Kylutsky, and Avachinsky. We also took helicopter trips to Kurile Lake and Valley of the Geysers. We also enjoyed camping and having our own four while drive vehicle gave us the flexibility to go anywhere we wanted. The scenery was fantastic — a combination of Iceland and Alaska, and it was great to camp at scenic spots. Of course, bears are a danger, but I bought bear spray just in case. Fortunately, we never needed to use it. One other caution is that while it is nice being able to drive on your own, the roads are pretty rough, so there is always the potential of getting stuck.

He went through<br>the local social media, discovered that<br>the luggage had been picked up by a local<br>tour company, and then went across town to<br>pick it up for us! Fantastic service. One<br>caution that I have about independent<br>travel in Kamchatka is that the English<br>level is not very high, so I had to<br>communicate using a google translator.<br>Despite not being able to read Russian, it<br>was relatively easy to find places using<br>the GPS on the phone and an app called<br>maps.me. Sergey pinpointed all the<br>locations to visit on the app, so I just<br>followed it. We visited Gorley, Mutsonova,<br>Kylutsky, and Avachinsky. We also took<br>helicopter trips to Kurile Lake and Valley<br>of the Geysers. We also enjoyed camping<br>and having our own four while drive<br>vehicle gave us the flexibility to go<br>anywhere we wanted. The scenery was<br>fantastic — a combination of Iceland and<br>Alaska, and it was great to camp at scenic<br>spots. Of course, bears are a danger, but<br>I bought bear spray just in case.<br>Fortunately, we never needed to use it.<br>One other caution is that while it is nice<br>being able to drive on your own, the roads<br>are pretty rough, so there is always the<br>potential of getting stuck. However, local<br>Russians are extremely kind, and were<br>extremely helpful when I needed help.",2018

Eva M,Belgium,2018-08-19,"My husband and me went to Kamchatka in the beginning of August, and found very little information in English for the independent traveler. This revue is a try to remedy this situation and make this wonderful peninsula a bit more accessible for people who don't want to book a tour guide. We landed in Yelizovo, and took the bus to PK from the airport (nr. 104). The bus stops just in front of the airport building, the first stop on the right hand side. You can get the ticket on the bus. PK itself is a very ugly city, with not that much to see. The street is divided in KM's, in the sense that the location is always given in relation to the sea. Therefore, KM0 is the city center, next to the harbor. We stayed in a guesthouse close to KM4, where the main church is found, the guesthouse was called The House, and was ok. On KM6 there is an interesting market where you can find all kinds of fresh fruits and vegetables, fish and meat, and a lot of other things like tipical Russian sweets. The main bus station to go out of town is on KM10. There we took the bus to Esso the next day, which leaves every day at 9am. However, it is advisable to buy the tickets a couple of days in advance. When we left, the only other tourists didn't have a ticket yet; for some of them there was still place, others needed to come back the day after. The ticket office is found in the building behind the bus parking lot. There is a small shopping mall, and behind the shopping mall, there is a small door with the ticket office for the bus to Esso. The cost was around EUR 30 per person. The bus takes 9 hours to reach Esso. At noon it stops in Milkovo, a small mining town, of little touristic interest. There is one restaurant that is open during lunch, but the food there is quite horrible, so you might want to bring a lunch with you. Especially in case of good wheather; We arrived in Esso aroun 17pm. We stayed at Grushanka guesthouse, which I would highly recommend, as Vladimir is one of the only people we have encountered in Esso who could speak English well. https://www.tripadvisor.nl/Hotel_Review-g2538810-d8517868-Reviews-Guest_House_Grushanka-Esso_Bystrinsky_District_Kamchatka_Krai_Far_Eastern_ cityDist.html In the centre went in which doubt to open the public pool in swimming nicest place in town. We also had diner at the only restaurant in town, but wouldn't really recommend it. The price was rather high, service was bad, and the food was edible, but nothing more than that. If your guesthouse has a kitchen or makes diner for their guests (both options existed at our guesthouse), that is a better option. The day after that we tried to walk in Bystrinsky National Park, but honestly, we were not impressed. There were 1000's of mosquitoes, so after two hours and litterally more than 200 bites per person, we gave up. We had mosquito spray, long trousers ... with us, but that all didn't matter. You really need to cover your head in one of those anti-bee-outfits if you want to try going out there. There are also bears in the forest, so you might want to take one of the horns to blow to scare them away which are available at the natural park information center. The Bystrinsky information center is located in the center of Esso. they are very friendly, but do not speak a word of English. My Russian is very basic, but somehow we managed to explain ourselves. So, they gave us this anti-bear horn, which we needed to bring back after the walk (there is a two-day walk, with 3 unguarded huts in the middle, in case you want to do the hike in 3 days instead) ... If you have a GPS - which I would recommend having for Kamchatka - they can install the track of the trail on your GPS. We didn't have a professional GPS, but used Maps.me on our cellphones, which worked perfectly well. It had all the trails indicated, throughout Kamchatka. The only problem was the battery of our cellphones, so we took an extra battery with us. After the failed trip at Bystrinsky Park - which we stopped because of the mosquitoes, and because honestly we didn't think the surroundings were that special. We both traveled extensively in the Alps before, and being compared to them, we think the Alps are more pretty than the part of Bystrinsky Park we got to see. With the help of our guesthouse-host we found out there are different what's app groups - all in Russian, where tours offer free places to travelers. He managed to arrange a trip for us to Tolbachik volcano for RUB 5000 each, while the normal price would be around RUB 15.000. The next day we left with a military-like truck to Tolbachik. We only paid RUB 5000 for the transport back and forth, so we weren't complaining, but basically we traveled for around 8h in the back of a truck without windows. They did give us a walkie talkie in case of an emergency, so they could unlock the back of te truck, as we couldn't open it ourselves. Anyhow, the travel was not very comfortable, but on the other hand, we got what we paid for. Normally people get a proper seat, in a bus with windows, plus food and tents which are provided. As we had our own tent, we were pretty independent. We arrived at Tolbachik basecamp in the early evening. The next day we went up the volcano, which was a spectacular walk. We left our tent in place, and only took a small backpack with food, water and warm clothes, and of course the GPS. The tracks in Kamchatka are never really indicated, even if locals say they are. True, often there is only one road, but then again, in the fog, it would be difficult to find your way without a GPS. Fortunately, we were very lucky with the wheather. We started our ascent next to the lava field. You follow the main road going up, until the lava field. The road for pedestrians continues on the left of the field. At a certain point, there are white marks on the lava field, where you have to cross it. This is the only part where you have to make sure that you don't miss this turn to the right. On the other side of the lava field, the road continues, until the crater. In total it is around 1500m of height difference (I don't know exactly, but it felt like something similar). The road is not very difficult though: it continues upwards quite steadily, but never too steep. Back and forth it took us around 9h. There are plenty of other nice places to do multiple day-trips in the region, but you would need to plan your trip back beforehand. We didn't plan to return later, and didn't bring enough food with us for multiple days either, so needed to go back the next day. From Tolbachik you could potentially even hike to Kluchi in I esteem around 7 days, but for Kluchi you would need to arrange a special permit beforehand. - All areas we visited were free of a special permit. Only some areas more north than Esso need permits, which should be obtained in PK. As we didn't want to return to Esso the day after, we asked the jeep to leave us on the main road between Kluchi and PK. From there we hitchhiked back. As it was already evening, we managed to get to Milkovo (halfway). About hitchhiking: we hitchhiked on several occasions, and it was very very very easy in Kamchatka. People are aware that otherwise you might be eaten by a bear, or nobody might pass until next morning, so ALL of the cars always stopped, either to take us with them, or to ask why we were there and if we had any problems. People are very friendly, even with my very limited Russian language skills. Milkovo is not impressive as a town. We stayed in hotel Geolog - there are 3 hotels in town, but no restaurant for the evening. As we didnt have a kitchen in our room, we ended up ordering take away pizza ... it took them over 2 hours to bring us the food. Anyhow, Milkovo has a new bus station (build in 2017-2018?) And several busses a day bring you to PK. We took a bus at 8 am. Other busses left at 10.30 and in the evening. Maybe there were more busses in the afternoon as well, I don't know. We went directly to the visitor center in Yelizovo, which is to be found on the first floor of the bus station in Yelizovo. The person working there (open Mo-Fr 10-18h) was very friendly, but spoke very limited English. There are some interesting flyers though. From Yelizovo we took bus nr. 111 (or was it 110, don't remember; one leaves from PK, the other from Yelizovo) to Paratunka - the town of the hot springs. Paratunka looks more like a street than a town though. We told the bus driver we wanted to get of at the way - they don't call it a street, because it lacks asphalt - to Mutnovskaya. He dropped us of at the right bus stop. There we waited about 5 minutes before getting a lift to the hydrotermal powerplant at the base of Mutnovskaya. When hitchhiking here, make sure that your driver is going either to the powerplant, to Gorely, or to a camping place which is to be found halfway. Other drivers we have met went into the forests on side roads, and it might be dangerous to stay on the mainroad in the middle of the forest alone, because of the bears. The ride from Paratunka to Mutnovskaya took us around 3hours (on the way back we hitchhiked with a tourist bus, which took about 4 hours to reach Paratunka). From the car park of the power plant, there is a food road on the right of the power plant, which takes you to the base camp in around 20 minutes - next to another building of the power plant. Just next to the base camp there is a small hot spring for bathing, which is really nice. The first day we left the tent in the basecamp, and with a small backpack we went up the Mutnovskaya crater. The road is quite long, but not difficult. Even though it was august, there was quite a lot of snow fields we needed to cross, so take hiking boots with you that can stand the water. Mutnovskaya crater is really the most interesting vulcanological phenomenon I have ever seen - way better than Tolbachik or even Iceland. It is really impressive, and should not be missed. The trip to the crater and back took us around 10h. The day aferwards, we took our tent and everything, and went to Gorely basecamp. We took the pass over the mountains instead of the roads for the cars. The way is not well indicated, and was not in our maps.me program either, but with good wheather you can't get lost. The negative part was that on the other side of the valley, there was even more snow, which made it a hard trek. It took us 4 hours to reach Gorely basecamp. We put up our tent, and took a small backpack to go up Gorely. This is a very easy walk (around 800m height difference), and back and forth it took us - a semi-circular tour around the crater included - around 4 more hours. Gorely is beautiful, but if you have to chose, Mutnovskaya is way more impressive - if you like volcanoes of course. The day after the Gorely ascent we hitchhiked back to Yelizovo. At that point, we didn't meet anybody who did not have a bear encounter - accept us, so we were really lucky. There are no cheap hotels in Yelizovo center, so we took a guesthouse which was reachable by marshrutka - minibus - nr. 8, at the end of the line. The minibus went 3 times an hour, and took about 10 minutes to reach the center. We had the best diner we had in Kamchatka in Art Hotel - a hotel in the city center, but which charges around EUR 100 for a room. The diner was - 3 courses and a bottle of wine around EUR 40 pp. The fish was excellent, and the service good - ok, we were the only customers, but still. The day after that we visited the Vulcanological museum in PK, very modern and well structured museum, with English (and Russian of course) explanations. You can also hire a guide, but the explanations are already pretty good by themselves. We had another ""fancy"" diner at Kamchatka Local Kitchen. The restaurant is around 1.5km walking from KM6 (not on the main road). The food was good, but it is definitely overpriced. Portions are small, and the whole atmosphere is very over the top, without having a good service. The waiters didn't know what they were doing, didn't speak english, and were not very friendly. Food was ok, but for the same price, the Art Hotel in Yelizovo is way better. We also asked around to have a final day tour. As we didn't encounter any bears on our journey, we thought about going to Kuril Lake in the south, but the price for a helicopter ride to Kuril started at EUR 600 per person. A boat trip in the Avacha bay was more affordable, at around EUR 100 per person, but still, for a boat trip, we didn't think it was worth the money, so we missed out on those things. Just to give you an idea: for our holiday of 10 days we paid EUR 500 per person, all included, apart from our flight tickets; and we did not have the impression to pay attention to what we spent. I hope you, readers, find these explanations useful. In case you still have further questions which you think I could answer about this wonderful place in Russia's Far East, feel free to contact me. Kamchatka certainly is worth visiting, even for the budget traveler!",10,tripadvisor,Kamchatka Peninsula,Belgium,BEL,1,"My husband and me went to Kamchatka in the<br>beginning of August, and found very little<br>information in English for the independent<br>traveler.

A<br>boat trip in the Avacha bay was more<br>affordable, at around EUR 100 per person,<br>but still, for a boat trip, we didn't<br>think it was worth the money, so we missed<br>out on those things. Just to give you an<br>idea: for our holiday of 10 days we paid<br>EUR 500 per person, all included, apart<br>from our flight tickets; and we did not<br>have the impression to pay attention to<br>what we spent. I hope you, readers, find<br>these explanations useful. In case you<br>still have further questions which you<br>think I could answer about this wonderful<br>place in Russia's Far East, feel free to<br>contact me. Kamchatka certainly is worth<br>visiting, even for the budget traveler!",2018
Robert C,United Kingdom,2018-08-17,"A group of us did the Rainbows from Above trip last year with Best of Kamchatka. We got some bad luck along the way that was beyond the outfitter's control (plane flight delayed a day, rain delayed the helicopter flight to camp another day) but for the part they could control it was poor. We're pretty serious fly fisherman and given the high cost we expected to get a lot of time on the water. Our camp wasn't near any water. I ended up with 15 hours on fishable water for the week (that worked out to about $ 1,000 an hour). The Russian guide and pilot wouldn't leave in the morning until 9:30 and wanted to go back to camp by 4 PM each day. Any signs of clouds and we headed back. Half of us got dropped on a river that was 3 inches deep and the guide didn't bring his radio to call the copter back so we hiked for the whole morning until we got to the copter. Lost another half day. When we did get to fish it was truly amazing. The whole experience is unique in a lot of ways. But it is hard to reconcile with the price and how little fishing we actually did. There was no discussing longer days with the Russians. Just told no. Pretty dismissive of our wishes. We talked to the American outfitter when we got back and Will was not happy about what happened but wouldn't refund any money including our helicopter fuel charges which were for 5.5 days when we only used 3 days.

Avraham G,United States,2017-03-10,"In August 2017 we visited Kamchatka, Russia for the first time. Two weeks should be considered minimal for a first visit there, certainly not enough, surely we will return for more. The place is amazing, in many aspects it is unique in comparison with other tourist destinations, and this is said after extended trips over the past 30 years to Australia, China, Japan, South East Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia & Indonesia ) to Europe and of course in the United States. Kamchatka is different, emphasis on different. Unless you are an extreme winter sports buff, the touring season in Kamchatka will limit your visit to the months of July - August, maybe from late June to Early September but that is already taking a risk with the weather. Not that in July or August you will sunbathe on a beach, no way, but at least there is a chance for relatively dry days and passable terrain, as most sites and sights in Kamchatka are accessible via rough gravel roads and by foot, some only by helicopter. So prepare for extensive walking. We arrived by flight from Anchorage. It is a weekly flight of Yakutia Airline which is available only 10 weeks each summer. Other options (certainly longer and perhaps cheaper) are via Beijing, Seoul, Tokyo, Moscow, and Vladivostok, Russia. But enough with the introduction, what we have seen and experienced is more important. Rafting and fishing on a river, climbing up volcanoes, viewing bears in the wild, walking by steaming Sulfur fumaroles and bubbling mud pools, with a native ethnic festival and a few museums to cap the visit, all this in two week - WOW !! ! Our host was Martha Madsen (an American from Homer, Alaska living in Kamchatka for over 20 years and worthy of a story in her own right) who runs a lovely Bed and Breakfast place in Yelizovo, as well as the Explore Kamchatka (www.explorekamchatka .com / explorekam@gmail.com) service. Martha organized the entire visit including tours, guides, translators, vehicles, helicopter flights, rafting, overnight stays, several visits to geo-thermal pools, in short - everything (!!!) in a most professional yet personal and friendly manner.

Toh A,Singapore,2017-09-22,"If you are contemplating on a trip to Kamchatka, look no more. Here, I would like to share with you my experience of an exotic, eye opening and memorable trip I had in this peninsula this summer / autumn. We traveled by helicopters and a 6WD army truck; crossing rivers in search for brown bears along the rivers choked with red salmons; sleeping in tents in valleys surrounded by volcanoes - one could feel the pulsation of the land when lying in the tents; hiking to view the calderas / craters, geysers, lava fields and volcanoes with gases spewing into the air. We encountered late summer, early autumn and winter climates over a day, and that made the landscapes even more lovely. This trip was made memorable because of our hosts from the Lost World. Our tour guide Artyom not only speaks fluent English, he is also experienced, knowledgeable and caring. He is passionate about his job and this land. I was touched when he braved the cold at 1-2 am to clear the snow that was weighing on our tents. He was quick to change itinerary when typhoon Samvu from Japan was heading towards Kamchatka. The Lost World took responsibility for our safety, the company was gracious in absorbing the extra hotel bills incurred. The cook Larissa kept us well fed with local cuisines better than those of the 4/5-star hotels. Jynia's driving skills was incrediable. He took us in the truck across ice fields, running streams, up and down hilly slopes and valleys full of lava. The trip ended with an unexpectedly exotic dinner in a choom (similiar to a yurt) in no-where. We were treated to salads of wild plants such as fenn, smoked salmons and Russian Volka.

iamarugger,China,2017-09-20,"Kamchatka is one of the most wild and remote places on the planet. You will many days get 4 seasons in one day. That being said you need to go with an open mind and a plethora of patience. If you do, you will have a fantastic time. If you are high strung, need things to be orderly and on schedule, and are looking for the four seasons this is not a place for you. Things are many times delayed / outright canceled due to weather or other logistical issues and are many times out of the hands of Lost World although people might attempt to blame them for these problems. We were on the bears and volcano tour. We started the trip with a very delayed helicopter trip to Kuril Lake. This lake is the place to see brown bears. We stayed in a lodge, about 8 to 10 to a room. Make sure to pack ear plugs in case anyone in your group snores. Electricity was on after 7 pm each night and there was hot water at night. Pack plenty of bug spray. We were using 98% deet and I recommend it. Also very chilly there when the wind picks up off the lake. The bears there are truly amazing. You will see 50 to 100 bears hunting salmon all over the area. They walks around the lake are second to none and the scenery is stunning. We took a helicopter from there to a hot spring and then we were diverted back to the helicopter airport due to weather. This forced us in to a 6 hour truck ride to the volcano. Once again the traveling in Kamchatka can be very challenging. The volcanoes are unbelievable. The hiking can be challenging at times especially on snow. One of the members of our group had to turn back although she was very unfit and smoked like a chimney. The geothermal activity here is world class. The second day much of the group chose not to hike the volcano as the ascent was at about a 60 degree angle for much of the hike and rarely leveled off. We also had a lovely boat trip through Avacha Bay and we hired a chef and dined to salmon caviar and crab (set up extra by out group). We stayed an extra coulpe of days and spend a few days rafting and fishing. This outfit is professional and knows there way around this very difficult region.

Dave & carla,United States,2016-09-12,"In late August 2016 I returned from my 4th visit to Kamchatka (7th to Russia). This visit was so much fun but too short so I'm determined to return for a longer stay. For my visits to Kamchatka I always seek out hiking, often up volcanoes if possible, and wildlife viewing. Kamchatka offers true wilderness and rivals my travels to Alaska, the Canadian arctic and Greenland for scenery, hiking and wildlife. Even if after reading this review, or regardless, feel free to contact me for further information. I do know a few people in the tourism industry that grew up in Kamchatka and would enjoy helping you with questions or any special endeavors! And they offer a lot of winter activities too. I stayed in the Art Hotel in downtown Elizovo (a few km from the airport, about 4500Ru for room with ensuite bath and breakfast and some WiFi) after making reservations there online. The desk clerks are very helpful with proficient English but not fluent. Previously my stays were in Petropavlovsk but having seen the sights there I find Elizovo more convenient and a nice small city. A former guide and interpreter (Lyuba) on my 2007 visit set up a 4 day tour with Kamchatsky Tour (kamchattour.ru). We had two young (30ish) brothers Dima and Sergey as our driver and guide (and I believe co-owners of the company), with Lyuba was my interpreter. Dima and Sergey were hilarious even with their sparse English but Lyuba filled in the gaps there as well as sharing some of her exploits with her sons and family. On this short tour we drive to Tolbachik volcano, camped one night there and had one full day of hiking. With a storm system moving in, after dinner we drove to Kozyrevsk and stayed in some small cabins - sort of a B&B setup with a banya for guests. Next day we drove to Klyuchevskaya Volcano, the highest volcano in Eurasia, hoping to get good view of it if Tolbachik would block the storm system. The weather didn't cooperate much, but as we approached Klyuchevskaya we did get some distant but good views of it, and also of Shiveluch Volcano - one of the most active volcanos in Kamchatka. Returning from Klyuchevskaya we drove to Esso and camped there, enjoying the public hot spring pool after dinner. We drove to Elizovo the next day. The weather ruined our second day of hiking at Tolbachik but this was a gamble I knew about and accepted. Usually I book longer tours with at least 2 weeks in Kamchatka. Kamchatsky Tour offers a wide selection of one to multi-day tours, like a one day ascent of Avacha volcano for 5500Ru (US $ 85 as of Sept 2016) per person with a group of 3-6 people. And much more (check out their Web page, the English translation isn't perfect but adequate). The exchange rate is very favorable for travel to Russia. In past years it has been about 30Ru per US $ 1 and now about 65Ru per US $ 1. I find the people in Kamchatka very friendly and helpful. In earlier trips (2007, 2013, 2014) trip I took the local bus, helicopter tours to the Valley of Geysers, and boat tour of the Avacha Bay with the locals and always found someone eager to help and often quite fluent in English - nice , to complement my 10 words of Russian! For about 7 weeks in the summer (approximately mid-July to late August) Yakutia Airlines offers weekly flights between Anchorage and Petropavlovsk, departing and returning on Monday. I booked my flights from airrussia.us, home office in Seattle, WA. If you wish to have lodging in Elizovo that is very inexpensive (1700Ru per person, shared room and bath) and an English speaking hostess, try Martha Explore Kamchatka (in Google Map search “explore kamchatka”). When I stayed there she picked us up and returned us to the airport, provided a hearty yet fresh breakfast, offered some WiFi (higher bandwidth Internet is in the works for Kamchatka) and general help. Her location is a short bus ride from Elizovo, but the Old Castle restaurant with English menus and a wide selection is a 1km walk from her B&B (in Google Map search “explore Kamchatka” then search “restaurants” to see location). Starting a few years ago Russian visas for US citizens are good for 3 years - and up to a 6 month stay. (Almost the same deal for them for US visas.) The visa application is online but still extensive; much better than the paper form. I obtained my visa in San Francisco about 10 days after delivering to my passport / visa service. Finally, as other reviewers have noted, travel in Kamchatka is very rugged. There are few paved roads even to some very popular destinations. Helicopters are used, not bush planes. All flying and some other modes are weather dependent. Like Alaska the weather often does not cooperate. But it offers outstanding wilderness experiences with friendly and competent guides and support at, what I find to be a very reasonable cost (some tour operators are an exception to that).",8,tripadvisor,Kamchatka Peninsula,USA,USA,20,"In late August 2016 I returned from my 4th<br>visit to Kamchatka (7th to Russia).

With a storm<br>system moving in, after dinner we drove to<br>Kozyrevsk and stayed in some small cabins<br>- sort of a B&B setup with a banya for<br>guests. Next day we drove to Klyuchevskaya<br>Volcano, the highest volcano in Eurasia,<br>hoping to get good view of it if Tolbachik<br>would block the storm system. The weather<br>didn't cooperate much, but as we<br>approached Klyuchevskaya we did get some<br>distant but good views of it, and also of<br>Shiveluch Volcano - one of the most active<br>volcanos in Kamchatka. Returning from<br>Klyuchevskaya we drove to Esso and camped<br>there, enjoying the public hot spring pool<br>after dinner. We drove to Elizovo the next<br>day. The weather ruined our second day of<br>hiking at Tolbachik but this was a gamble<br>I knew about and accepted. Usually I book<br>longer tours with at least 2 weeks in<br>Kamchatka. Kamchatsky Tour offers a wide<br>selection of one to multi-day tours, like<br>a one day ascent of Avacha volcano for<br>5500Ru (US $ 85 as of Sept 2016) per<br>person with a group of 3-6 people. And<br>much more (check out their Web page, the<br>English translation isn't perfect but<br>adequate). The exchange rate is very<br>favorable for travel to Russia. In past<br>years it has been about 30Ru per US $ 1<br>and now about 65Ru per US $ 1. I find the<br>people in Kamchatka very friendly and<br>helpful. In earlier trips (2007, 2013,<br>2014) trip I took the local bus,<br>helicopter tours to the Valley of Geysers,<br>and boat tour of the Avacha Bay with the<br>locals and always found someone eager to<br>help and often quite fluent in English -<br>nice , to complement my 10 words of<br>Russian! For about 7 weeks in the summer<br>(approximately mid-July to late August)<br>Yakutia Airlines offers weekly flights<br>between Anchorage and Petropavlovsk,<br>departing and returning on Monday. I<br>booked my flights from airrussia.us, home<br>office in Seattle, WA. If you wish to have<br>lodging in Elizovo that is very<br>inexpensive (1700Ru per person, shared<br>room and bath) and an English speaking<br>hostess, try Martha Explore Kamchatka (in<br>Google Map search “explore kamchatka”).<br>When I stayed there she picked us up and<br>returned us to the airport, provided a<br>hearty yet fresh breakfast, offered some<br>WiFi (higher bandwidth Internet is in the<br>works for Kamchatka) and general help. Her<br>location is a short bus ride from Elizovo,<br>but the Old Castle restaurant with English<br>menus and a wide selection is a 1km walk<br>from her B&B (in Google Map search<br>“explore Kamchatka” then search<br>“restaurants” to see location). Starting a<br>few years ago Russian visas for US<br>citizens are good for 3 years - and up to<br>a 6 month stay. (Almost the same deal for<br>them for US visas.) The visa application<br>is online but still extensive; much better<br>than the paper form. I obtained my visa in<br>San Francisco about 10 days after<br>delivering to my passport / visa service.<br>Finally, as other reviewers have noted,<br>travel in Kamchatka is very rugged. There<br>are few paved roads even to some very<br>popular destinations. Helicopters are<br>used, not bush planes. All flying and some<br>other modes are weather dependent. Like<br>Alaska the weather often does not<br>cooperate. But it offers outstanding<br>wilderness experiences with friendly and<br>competent guides and support at, what I<br>find to be a very reasonable cost (some<br>tour operators are an exception to that).",2016

We spent 4 days hiking up live volcanoes - seeing spectacular views, walking on still hot lava in places. We also rafted the river for 2 days and saw lots of bears (including at least 3 with cubs in tow). Travel was in a large unimog type truck so very slow and over bumpy terrain for much of it but all part of the experience. The helicopter ride to Valley of Geysers was expensive but worth it we thought. Also the boat trip was good value and we had fresh crabs for lunch.

Michael L,China,2015-08-02,"Wife and I visited Kamchatka with Lost World Tour 22 Jul to 31 Jul 2015. They deserved five stars. Bears: I had 53 sightings of bears on my birthday alone. Volcanoes: I wasn't new to volcanoes, having previously walked mt. Etna twice and been to Vulcano (Aeolian Islands), still I found the ones we visited breathtaking. Personnel: Nice and responsive Andrey, the manager of the company has been helpful all along, answered all our questions promptly prior to the trip and appeared very hands-on with managing each tour group whilst we were there. Our beautiful guide Galina was part-time (works as an English teacher full-time) but knows her trade reasonably well and was very helpful and attentive to our needs. Of course, to be honest with you I think a major reason why we were taken care of so well was also down to the fact that the small group size of only nine people (there were 16 in group after ours). Arrangements: hearty all the destinations in the itinerary were stunning. We had a bad day on our second day when the weather conditions at the Kurilskoye Lake was not good enough for the helicopter to land and we were stuck in Petropavlovsk, but this was down to luck not organization. Lost World arranged a city tour on that day for us which of course was not enough to offset our disappointment, but then they helped arrange a third night (we were scheduled to have three nights there but the lost day meant we could only stay two nights ) for our group to stay in make shift tents at the lodge that was already taken by the next group. They even arranged a lake side shed (the house of the head ranger) with a double bed coz my wife was pregnant. Very nice of them, much appreciated. They made similar arrangements and the Gorely Volcano campsite and placed two beds in a tent to spare my pregnant wife from sleeping on the ground. Vicki, the cook at the lodge even made me a birthday cake with a gas stove. Accommodation: good enough for me Hotel Petropavlovsk - could have been better, only thing good about it was the free wifi The lodge at Kurilskoye Lake - conditions not as bad as many described in reviews you'd find on the Internet, I loved it Base Camp at the Gorely Volcano - well, it's your usual campsite, conditions reasonable Hotel Bel Kam Tour - Found it nice after a few nights at the lodge and the campsite, wifi was slow and not free Catering: one area they really could and should improve on. But you could always take your own provisions, one in our group bought caviar in Petropavlovsk and brought it to the lodge. Thanks to him we had caviar pancakes for breakfast for a few days. The high point was towards the end of the trip in the cruise in Avatcha Bay when we enjoyed fresh sea urchins picked and opened by divers on the spot and sashimi of the fish my wife caught. Value for money: yes I found it expensive, but it's a one in a lifetime experience, worth it if you could afford it. I think the part that costs the company the most was the helicopter transportation.

ElioTsarodej,Italy,2014-11-16,"The aim of this review is confute the huge list of stereotypes about Kamchatka. Before having been there, I thought that it was one of the most difficult places to travel; afterwards, it was quite difficult, but the only reason was the lack of information on the internet about Kamchatka. Had I found a review like the one I am writing, my travel would have been much easier: I hope that this review will be helpful to other travelers. The stereotypes can be divided into two categories: -1- Stereotypes of foreigners about Kamchatka (I actually read many of these on TripAdvisor) 1.1 Whatever visa you have for Russia, it won't allow you to go to Kamchatka. To get a visa for Kamchatka you have to contact an unbelievably expensive travel agent that will arrange the visa for you. ==> WRONG: russian visas allow their holders to go anywhere in the territory of Russian Federation (which by the way is the widest border-free land on the globe, even though few westerners realize it). If you have, let's say a humanitarian visa on which is registered the city of St Peterburg, you can still go to Kamchatka on the other side of the globe and be perfectly legal. 1.2 In Kamchatka, and in general in the remote Far East, policemen are more likely to control you, and ask you for money, send you to prison, etc. ==> WRONG: russian policemen just don't care about foreigners. I have been traveling alone through all Siberia until Kamchatka and I have been controlled only once, in Ekaterinburg, because I actually entered in a private room of the train station, which I took erroneously for the baggage deposit. The policeman just opened the passport on the first page without even looking at the visa, smiled and let me go. Another wrong stereotype is about bribes! Probably during Soviet Union people were poor and bribes were more common, but now it's just not convenient for any policeman to accept bribes, because their job is good and they don't want to risk loosing it. 1.3 Russia is dangerous, let's not speak about Kamchatka which is so remote! You will find yourself alone in the forest with some drunk big guy threatening you with a Kalashnikov. ==> WRONG: First, Russia is not more dangerous than, let's say, US and Spain. Of course there are pickpocketers, and if you go alone in lonely places during the night it's possible that you have some bad experience, but this is just what happens everywhere in the world except for Scandinavia. Second, all the cities in Siberia and Far East are so modern, clean and safe! Also, you have to realize that in the Far East and in Kamchatka there are almost no foreigners, so when you travel there most people will be curious at you and helpful (even if you don't speak russian). NOTE about points 1.2 and 1.3: they are valid unless you drive your own car with non-russian plate. If you do this you will attract the thieves, and you'll have more troubles with the police because of the very complicated laws about driving foreign cars. -2- Stereotypes of russians about Kamchatka (yes, also russians don't know much about it) 2.1 If you go to Kamchatka you have to spend 1000 USD a day, pay for helicopters, expensive boats, etc ==> WRONG: there are a couple of things that are reachable only by helicopter (two or three volcanoes), but you can perfectly go to Kamchatka on your own, take a public bus, visit an attraction, eat in a normal restaurant, etc. Actually, if you don't take the helicopter to go on the top of that volcano you don't loose anything, because, even though such volcanoes are beautiful, you can find similar attractions in many other places in the world such as Iceland, New Zealand, Alaska, Indonesia. Kamchatka has many unique things, but excursions on a volcano with a helicopter are not among them 2.2 Hotels are so expensive, you'll pay 100 USD a night ==> WRONG: actually the hotels you find in the internet are expensive, but on the place there are many hostels for 10 USD a night. There is one in Elizovo, the city of the airport, there is another one at km 11 (a neighborood of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskij), and there is a wonderful one just in the center of old town in Petropavlovsk (it's called Hostel24). You cannot find them easily on the internet, and you cannot call them from abroad (or even from other regions of Russia: the line is very bad and calls are expensive), but generally they don't need reservations because there are very few tourists ... There are also very cheap hostels in other cities of Kamchatka: in Esso for example you can find an accommodation as cheap as 300 rubles (6 euros). And just for a few euros more (around 15 euros a night) you can stay in very comfortable places with natural warm water pools, such as Grushanka, which I warmly recommend. One thing, you might need a reservation if you are going during peak season (July - August): in this case I suggest you to make a reservation with Hostel24 in PK (Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskij) and ask them if they can call to reserve for you the accommodation in other cities of Kamchatka. 2.3 There is no public transportation, nor roads, nor cities, nor people, only bears ==> WRONG: Kamchatka has a very good public transportation system. Every day a bus leaves PK to go to Esso and other cities. There are many wonderful small towns that deserve a visit, such as Mil'kovo. You can perfectly organize your trip alone and enjoy it. Be aware that the most important place, if you want to organize your trip, is the bus station in Km11 (a part of PK, which is called Km11 because it is 11 km away from the old town): in the bus station you will find timetables and everything you need. It's open every day, also on sunday. 2.4 Unless you go in July - August you will be covered by snow and won't be able to do anything. ==> WRONG: May, June, September and October are perfectly fine, it's not cold at all. And even during winter, when there is a lot of snow (but it's not very cold, because it's south and there is the influence of the Pacific, if in Siberia you have -30 C °, in Kamchatka you rarely go below -10 ° ), if you just stay in PK I believe you will enjoy it a lot. The bay of PK is one of the most beautiful places I have seen in the world, together with Lofoten Islands, Gambier Islands and Ushuaia. It's a unique place where you mix northern atmosphere with Soviet Union buildings and volcanoes, volcanoes, volcanoes! It's true that it's difficult to have a perfect clear day, but on the other side clouds (and even fog) are so beautiful over that bay! Guess how beautiful it would be with snow and ice in the bay. 2.4 Flying to Kamchatka is expensive ==> WRONG: Go and visit www.s7.ru",10,tripadvisor,Kamchatka Peninsula,Italy,ITA,7,"The aim of this review is confute the huge<br>list of stereotypes about Kamchatka.<br>Before having been there, I thought that<br>it was one of the most difficult places to<br>travel; afterwards, it was quite<br>difficult, but the only reason was the<br>lack of information on the internet about<br>Kamchatka.

Every day a bus leaves PK to go to<br>Esso and other cities. There are many<br>wonderful small towns that deserve a<br>visit, such as Mil'kovo. You can perfectly<br>organize your trip alone and enjoy it. Be<br>aware that the most important place, if<br>you want to organize your trip, is the bus<br>station in Km11 (a part of PK, which is<br>called Km11 because it is 11 km away from<br>the old town): in the bus station you will<br>find timetables and everything you need.<br>It's open every day, also on sunday. 2.4<br>Unless you go in July - August you will be<br>covered by snow and won't be able to do<br>anything. ==> WRONG: May, June, September<br>and October are perfectly fine, it's not<br>cold at all. And even during winter, when<br>there is a lot of snow (but it's not very<br>cold, because it's south and there is the<br>influence of the Pacific, if in Siberia<br>you have -30 C °, in Kamchatka you rarely<br>go below -10 ° ), if you just stay in PK I<br>believe you will enjoy it a lot. The bay<br>of PK is one of the most beautiful places<br>I have seen in the world, together with<br>Lofoten Islands, Gambier Islands and<br>Ushuaia. It's a unique place where you mix<br>northern atmosphere with Soviet Union<br>buildings and volcanoes, volcanoes,<br>volcanoes! It's true that it's difficult<br>to have a perfect clear day, but on the<br>other side clouds (and even fog) are so<br>beautiful over that bay! Guess how<br>beautiful it would be with snow and ice in<br>the bay. 2.4 Flying to Kamchatka is<br>expensive ==> WRONG: Go and visit<br>www.s7.ru",2014

TravelTheWorld44,Australia,2014-07-26,"My family has spend 9 days in Kamchatka on a private tour with Lost World company. It was always the place I really wanted to visit and decided my kids were old enough to do it as a family. We didn't know what to expect when we were planning this trip particularly from the logistics perspective and I have found the comments on this forum very helpful. So here is my reflection on our trip with a view to assist whoever wants to venture into this relatively unknown world of tourism (outside of Russia of course). to start off be ready for: 1.to be challenged physically and emotionally - the infrastructure is very run down and it was also surprising to see in some places everyday rubbish which probably never gets cleaned up amongst the amazing UNESCO scenery - just have to ignore ... tour does have a fare number of rough-and-tough parts with no toilets or very primitive ones - only takes a day to get used to it really. if you never slept in a tent prior to tour suggest you give it a go before going to Kamchatka - the best places you can't get to without slipping in a tent and you really don't want to miss out. 2.totally unpredictable weather - it is easy to blame the tour company for rain and snow and other bad conditions. But a better approach is to be prepared and do your research - suggest for 9 days allocate at least 2 days for 'in case of bad weather' activities and be very clear with the company what you'd like to do in that case prior. Also suggest to add an extra 2 days to your trip if you've decided to go with pre-defined itinerary, or if you can do a private tour allocate at least 2 days to activities which you are OK to give a miss n case of bad weather. We were lucky I think - or so it seemed - that we managed to travel to all parts we've planned to travel to. The only unfulfilled desire was climbing a volcano - may be we have to come back one day;) 3.in summer a lot of mosquitoes around the river banks and generally places with water like hot springs - we were not ready for it and got bitten really badly ... buy local anti-mozzie protection (ask your guide for recommendation) and cover yourself as much as possible even on a hot day. 4.it is cold near the mountains in early summer - bring snow warm clothes. 5. lots of traveling from place to place - 3-5 hrs in a car. bring music and games. try to do: 1. get to know the locals on your tour - may be we were lucky but I have to say all the staff on our trip - cook, driver, guide, interpreter - were absolutely great and funny and very warm hearted people ... Russian have a great sense of black humor and lots of stories to tell which will stay with you for long. They also really like their country and keen to tell / show you not well known secrets - just ask. 2. we've actually quite liked the food that was cooked on a tour. There weren't many fruits and most vegetables were cooked - but we went in early summer so this is just a reflection of the season I think. From Russian food we've particularly and therefore recommend - kvas (traditional drink sold along the road usually), buckwheat porridge with meat / veg rissoles cooked on a tour), dumplings with cherries and potatoes (at the restaurants in hotels), caviar and various types of smoked fish - the best we've tried anywhere else in the world (have to buy it at the markets - most tours will take you there). And of course there is an amazing taste of Kamchatka's crab !!!!! 3. scenery - this is what this place is about. Don't think any recommendations are necessary - no matter where you go and what you do you'd be amazed by the expanse of beauty and a completely unreal (almost eerie at times) sense of world at its beginnings. it is all around you. One of the best views is from the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatski hotel rooms - my son said 'mum, these mountains don't look real - like someone has drawn them on a piece of paper and just spread sugar on the top (there was still snow on the mountains when we went which was early July). ' Europe and NZ and Japan and US do have similar landscapes - but we all agreed Kamchatka is unique and different somehow - it seemed to me that color of the sky and grass and rivers is richer and more intense ... we didn't go to Esso and Kyrilskoe lake - we were too early for bears and Esso was a bit far away, but would think these would be some of the best places to experience uniqueness of Kamchatka. 4.volcano climbing - if in Kamchatka try to do climb at least one! we've planned Mytnovski / Gorely trip - but the weather didn't work out. 5.avacha bay boat trip - excellent! fishing trip on one of the rivers - really great fun 6. Avachnski volcano - we've only wandered around and climbed the camel mount and we didn't have time for Avachincki climb. really beautiful place so definitely recommend. 7. spend at least half a day in the city - we've liked the museum, gift shop (which is like a museum), triny church - new and very pretty and good views over the city, and markets of course. tour company and prices: Lost World has done a great job for us and I wouldn't say the prices were over the top although definitely on expensive side - with exception of helicopter prices which are ridiculous and can't be negotiated by tour companies. However one can see and do a lot without helicopters. In terms of tour prices you just have to compare to Alaska tours - Kamchatka value for money is much much better. All in all I think we'd like to go back some day and we'd probably would use Lost World again - and go to more remote Northern places.

Mac808,Malaysia,2014-01-16,"This was an experience of a lifetime. The trip delivered on seeing the bears, active volcanoes, awesome hiking, rugged country, spectacular views from the helicopter and mountain tops. The boat cruise into Avacha Bay with the seafood lunch was really nice. The tour of the Volcanology Institute was interesting. Our guide, Artyom, was brilliant - knowledgeable, fluent English, sense of humor and flexible. One of the tour company owners, Andrey, is excellent with his replies and advice. Would I go back? No, as I have now been, seen and have fantastic photos. Would I recommend it? Yes, for the experience, but prepare yourself for a company that is not really customer focussed. It is a lot of money and the company does not give value for that money. This company has the monopoly in this area and I felt took advantage of this. We were extremely lucky with the weather and got to do most things on the itinerary. However, we had friends (a few weeks after us) who missed out on the Avacha bay trip due to weather and the company did not organize a ""Plan B '. They were left to their own devices. Be prepared for weather delays. There are museums, art galleries, volcanology institute, Russian Orthodox Churches, shops and markets that tourists may be interested in and the tour company should be able to organize something to see these in the case of bad weather.FOOD: I understand that we were out in the wild and I would eat what I was given. However, I feel that chicken heart soup as the only dish at lunch is unacceptable! When in the restaurants in Petropavlosk or Paratunka there were no menu choices. I don't expect the full menu but at least a choice of a meat, fish or vegetarian dish- not just be given the meal of the day. The vegetarians in our group had a difficult time with what was placed in front of them and in some cases they ordered off the menu and paid separately. The ""4 star"" hotel in Par atunka knew they had a group of 16 coming, but they still ran out of fries, the beer was warm and they only had 1 bottle of the wine we selected. ALL drinks (including water) were not covered in the tour price. The itinerary stated that we would eat out in a restaurant in the town - this didn't happen, we were only dining at the hotel restaurant with a preset menu. Our lunch on the last day was not included. SAFETY: what safety? The helicopter had no seat belts, no life-jackets, no emergency exit other than the one we entered through (the back doors where they loaded the luggage through were wired together when closed) and the luggage was not secured. It was piled up chest height in the center of the helicopter with not one luggage net or tie down in place! When we were picked up from the lake the pilot was yelling out through the window ""quick quick"" ""quick quick the fog is coming in""! We flew to the helicopter base as the weather was too bad to take us to the base of the volcano to the tents. At one stage the cockpit door was open, it was a total white out through the front window and the 3 in the cockpit were flying by what they could see through the windows at their feet and local knowledge. We were in a very mountainous area and had to fly through a pass. At one stage the helicopter slowed down and dropped altitude as they could not see. It meant something when we landed safely and the 3 in the cockpit all shook each other's hand and congratulated each other! The Kamaz truck we were transported to the volcano in got stuck in snow and it took almost two hours, with all of us helping, to get it out. This was unlucky, but lucky for us it occurred during daylight hours. The night we were driven to the tents because the helicopter was unable to land, meant we were driving over these snow fields in the middle of the night 2 days earlier. It would have been extremely cold if this had happened then. There was a bear in the area. BATHROOM FACILITIES: the bathrooms in the two hotels we stayed in were not fancy but they did the job. Be aware that in summertime the water supply in Petropavlosk undergoes its annual maintenance and the water gets turned off for 2-3 days. People in the tour group after us had no water for toilet or showers during their stay! The toilet facility at the lake and the volcano tent area was disgusting. I have used many long drops in my life and these were a disgrace. At the tent area there was only one long drop for about 50 people which is a squat style, hole cut in wood and you can imagine what was on the wood and the smell. The two toilets at the lake were long drops but with a toilet bowl / seat and not clean. A bathroom was being built in the lodge at the lake and they did turn the hot water on one night, when asked to, for those that wished to shower. AIRPORT TRANSFER: minor detail, but we were left for approximately two hours sitting in the company bus at the airport waiting for another plane to arrive. I felt for the money paid for this tour they should either have put us in a taxi to the hotel, or taken us in and then come back out to pick up the other passengers. SLEEPING: We took our own sleeping bag and roll up mattress for in the tent and in the lodge, but having seen the ones that were available to rent, I would rent to save weight / space in the suitcase. At the lodge there are 8 beds (3 bunk beds and 2 singles) in each of the two rooms. The rooms are extremely small and should really only have 4 people in them to be comfortable. The tents are meant to be 3 person but the two of us took up most of the tent and our luggage was on the outside of the tent. This trip was an experience of a lifetime, a moderate degree of fitness is required to manage the volcanoes where the views are spectacular, make sure you take a good camera, lots of memory storage and spare batteries (there were facilities to recharge). Walking poles were helpful and a camelback water system daypack is ideal for the hikes. I have given this an excellent rating as the experience was amazing, however my rating for the tour company would be poor to average.

The places we saw were exactly like what was shown in Natgeo / Discovery and other sceintific knowledge TV channels. Before you go to Kamchatka, be prepared for these things. a. There are only a few tourist companies who can correspond with you in English and it will be very difficult to do this alone even if you know Russian. b. This place and tours are very expensive. A grand Canyon helicopter tour in Las Vegas will cost only USD 250 per person where as a helicopter tour of Valley of Geysers will cost USD 1000 per person. A boat excursion of Avecha Bay costed us USD 750 (for 6 hours with a lunch) for 2 persons and a simlar tour in Cape Town or in Paracas costed me less than USD 100 for both of us. ... c. Be prepared for very quick changes in weather and you would end up doing nothing but waiting for helicopter to fly for many days. Usually, allow 2 extra days even in their Summer time. d. Be prepared to live in primitive conditions when you tour the volcanos (very small tents, very cold nights and natural toilets). e. You will get very basic food. f.

Shoes - comfortable, higher and lighter with a good tread + leggings (otherwise you will scoop up the slag on the descent). I recommend trekking sticks very, very much (!!!) Sunglasses. Sunscreen and chapping cream. From food I recommend nuts (you can eat without stopping), chocolate and sweets, bacon, a thermos with strong sweet) and no alcohol. Water 1.5 liters 0.5 each (3 bottles). It is customary to have a snack once at an altitude of 2000m, there are improvised benches.

We booked our tour through ""Kray"" email them at kraytour@mail.ru. The phone number is 8 (415-2) 48-44-61. The office staff is very friendly but probably only speak Russian. They do have guides on staff that speak English. Pay for your trip in rubles. We paid 30,000 rubles per person, but some individuals on the same tour had paid 1050 Euros or an equivalent of 52,659 rubles. The company has a sign on the main road. Drive all the way back to a guard tour and then they may or may not let you through the gate. You can park and walk back along the rundown looking buildings all the way to the back. The office is on the right and is quite nice inside. We visited the Kronotsky Reserve in the last days of September, which was after the main tourism season. We were on the last flight that the company offered for the year. The colors were beautiful! Plan extra days into your trip that allow for cancellation because of in-climate weather. We were originally scheduled to go two days prior to our actual flight but the helicopter was not allowed to fly. Both times, we arrived at the company office at 9:30 am and the decision to fly or not made until about 11am. We were served tea, open faced sandwiches and candy as we waited. There was also a nice selection of books to look at. The helicopter was very loud and we wore ear protection. The crew seemed very competent and we felt safe. Seats were along the sides and were not very comfortable for watching out the window or taking pictures. Be sure to sit next to a window that opens so that you won't get glare when you take pictures. Also, you may want to sit on the left side going and coming. That way the sun will not be as much of an issue in your pictures. Our tour consisted of three stops. The first stop was the Valley of the Geysers. There are about 40 geysers located on a total of 1.54 square miles. Visitors walk on wooden walkways and groups are timed so that no two groups are in the same place at the same time. There is an opportunity to watch a geyser go through the 4 stages of eruption. The second stop was in the Uzon Caldera. This area covers 38.6 acres and includes mud volcanoes, hot springs, cold rivers, a chloride lake, mud pots, mountains, tundra and other cold water lakes. We saw bear tracks. This was probably the most beautiful spot we saw on the Peninsula. The third stop was at a hot springs where we were allowed to either swim or fish. We chose to fish because the pool area was inside and small. We caught 3 fish and snagged a few that got away. We walked to the left when everyone else went to the right. The salmon were bountiful but it was necessary to snag them by dragging the hook over their backs. That way we could catch them in the fins. We were allowed to take our catch home and we determined that we had caught Chum salmon. They were mild and tasty. Lunch was served on the third stop and final stop, so be sure to bring some snacks along to hold you over until about 3pm.

Andrew M,United Kingdom,2017-12-28,"Mutnovsky is one of the most accessible of the many volcanoes on Kamchatka. It is located in the Yuzhno-Kamchatsky Nature Park and is accessible all year. The name Mutnovsky, translated into english, is ""the cloudy"", which relates to the unpredictable weather in this area.It is 70 kilometers south of PPK, and you will pass through the villages of Yelizov, Nikolayevka, Paratunka and Termalnij. We had planned to trek to the peak of Mutnovsky, but the notoriously bad Kamchatka weather prevented this. We had to be content with a drive on the Glacier and Glacier walk. Mutnovsky is a little over 2,300 meters tall, and has had major eruptions in the 1940's and 1960. The last eruption was in 2000. The road was rough as expected, but the truck that we traveled in was great, and easily managed the challenges presented by the volcano. Our first stop was at the entrance to the nature reserve, which had three totem poles, and many small piles of rocks that seemed to be a tribute to the mountain. We were used to seeing these piles of rocks as trail markers when trekking on mountains.The views here of the Glacier and mountains was good, but the thick fog prevented us from getting great pictures.A short drive from the entrance, the driver had to put ""snow chains"" on the tires for the Glacier drive. We drove for almost an hour on the Glacier and stopped quite a few times to walk on the Glacier and take photos. There are quite a few rivers on Mutnovsky, and these make for great photos with the various hills in the background. At the western end of the north crater, the Vulkannaya river turns into a 80 meter waterfall known as ""dangerous canyon"" - Russian translation ""Ovrag Opasny"". This area is awesome! The views are great and the wind was extremely strong. We had to take great care here when taking photos, as a wrong step would mean a fatal fall in the canyon below. The photos here are worth the trip, even if the weather does not allow a trek on the volcano. We walked the Glacier to an ice cave, and viewed many other interesting formations of the volcano. We were particularly interested in the amount of green vegetation that survived amidst all the ice covering. When planning a trip to volcanoes in PPK, give yourself at least a week, as the weather may prevent you from going and realistically you may have a maximum of 2 good days per week. We had planned to climb Avachinsky the previous day, and it was canceled due to the bad weather.We plan to return to PPK, as our time was limited to six days, and the weather was bad throughout.

brigitte235,Brazil,2016-08-22,"The trip took place in August 2016 and experienced the rise of 4 volcanoes: Tolbachik, Goreli, Mutnovsky and Avacha. Tolbachik is the farthest north, and it took us more than a day to get to. The landscape surrounding it is impressive, as it consists of a thick crust of lava that is still moving and boiling in places. It is kilometers by kilometers long - as far as the eyes could see, would be a fitting expression, except that we were not able to see everything as we were shrouded in rain and fog during our visit to Tolbachik. In hindsight, I would leave visiting this volcano from my itinerary, as the path is too long (3 days return) for a little return. Our guide stated that it has 2 clear days out of 20, lifts over the past few years. Mutnovsky and Goreli are the most impressive volcanoes and very convenient to climb. Russian families leave their cars in the garage underneath and rely on luck with the kids and the dogs. Walk of the day on Sunday, so say. Avacha volcano lift is probably the most excellent (along with Tolbachik). That was very, very strong and there is a real excursion in the snow before the summit. Again, the crater was shrouded in fog and there was no clear view. Looking back: climbing the volcanoes was a fun stretch but not much to get rid of in terms of viewing as the weather in Kamchatka is very unstable. It can also be quite boring to go on a difficult 12 hour climb and achieve a magnificent view of everything. You also need to consider that the roads are bad and that you will spend an irregular amount of time driving.
